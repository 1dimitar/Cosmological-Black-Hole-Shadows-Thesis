A black hole (BH) shadow is a dark region on an observer’s sky where light from distant
sources is completely absorbed due to a BH’s strong gravitational pull. The first direct
image of a BH shadow, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) in 2019, not only
confirmed the existence of BHs, but also highlighted the importance of understanding their
visual appearance. The angular size of a BH’s shadow is significantly larger than its event
horizon, since the former is determined by the gravitational lensing of light rays emitted
from unstable photon orbits.

This dissertation presents an in-depth theoretical study of BH shadows across various
spacetimes, with a focus on the impact of cosmic expansion. We begin by analysing static
and spherically symmetric BH spacetimes, deriving a general expression for their shadow’s
angular size and applying it to the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström solutions. Next, we
explore stationary spacetimes, where inertial frame-dragging effects in rotating BHs deform
the shadow shape. In particular, the photon orbits and the BH shadow in the Kerr spacetime
were studied extensively. Finally, we investigate cosmological BHs embedded in an expanding
FLRW universe, using the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) and McVittie solutions to model
how a dynamic universe influences shadows for both static and comoving observers. This
leads us to develop an approach for obtaining the angular size of a BH shadow in a general
cosmology.
